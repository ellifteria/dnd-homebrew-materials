            There shall be others seeking the same prize.

            As is to be expected, the promise of gold and glory attracted more
            than just your merry band of adventurers to LOCATION. Other teams
            have thrown their hats into the ring, hoping to be the ones to down
            the Golden Stag. While others have tried and failed before, the
            allure of riches and fame deters neither the braveâ€”nor the foolish.

                Sir Andred, the youngest son of the Count of LOCATION, has long
                sought to make a name for himself and emerge out from the long
                shadows cast by his legendary father and elder brother.

            <p class="dropcap">
                The area of LOCATION, while a beautiful locale, is not known for
                its economic productivity, something which has forced many into
                the life of a mercenary or sell-sword.
