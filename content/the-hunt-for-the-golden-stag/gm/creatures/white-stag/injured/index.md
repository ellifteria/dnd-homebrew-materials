- **Innate Spellcasting:** The White Stagâ€™s innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

### Bonus Actions

- **Enraged Charge:** Once every 3 rounds, Injured White Stag is able to rage and and move 30 ft. If the Injured White Stag rages, any rolls it makes in the rest of that round are taken at advantage. The following round, the Injured White Stag's walking speed is decreased to 0.
